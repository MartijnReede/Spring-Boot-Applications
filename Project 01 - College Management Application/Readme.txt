-- COLLEGE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION --

This is my first Spring Boot web application. The main goal was to practice with:
  - JPA
  - H2
  - Thymeleaf
  - MVC

-- FUNCTIONALITY --

This application provides an online platform where teachers and students can manage their courses and grades. 
Each user has a personal account showing only their personal information.
There are three types of accounts:
  - Student accounts
  - Teacher accounts
  - Admin accounts
  
Each account type has its own specific functionality. 

-- STUDENT ACCOUNT --

Student dashboard: 
  - The students can see all the courses they are enrolled in. 
  - The courses are divided in three categories: not started, in progress or completed. 
  
Manage courses:
  - The students can enroll for available courses. Available courses are courses that are in the "not started" 
  category and have not reached the maximum amount of students yet. 
  - At the bottom of the page, the students can see for what courses they are enrolled in. 

Grades:
  - The students can view their personal grades.
